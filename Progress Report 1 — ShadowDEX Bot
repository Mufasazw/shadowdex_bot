## Overview

This report summarizes the current development status of the ShadowDEX Telegram bot project.

## Completed Tasks

* **Project Setup:**

  * Initialized Python virtual environment and installed dependencies.
  * Configured environment variables using `.env` for secure token and database URL management.

* **Database Integration:**

  * Set up PostgreSQL database connection with SQLAlchemy ORM.
  * Created `User` model to store Telegram user data (`telegram_id`, `username`, `created_at`).
  * Verified successful connection and basic CRUD operations with the database.

* **Telegram Bot Core:**

  * Developed and tested the `/start` command to register new users and welcome returning users.
  * Handled cases where users may have no Telegram username gracefully.
  * Implemented basic error handling for database operations within command functions.

* **Code Structure:**

  * Modularized code into `main.py`, `db.py`, and `models.py` for clarity and maintainability.
  * Utilized environment variables for sensitive information.

## Next Steps

* Fully implement and test additional bot commands as planned.
* Consider enhancing user interaction with inline buttons and menus after core functionality is stable.
* Integrate token and market data APIs for real-time information retrieval.
* Improve error handling and logging for better monitoring.

## Notes

* Database credentials and bot tokens are managed securely via `.env` file.
* The project is currently in an early MVP phase focused on user registration and basic interaction.
