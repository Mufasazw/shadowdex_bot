# 🛣️ ShadowDEX Bot — Project Roadmap

Welcome to the official roadmap of **ShadowDEX Bot**, a Telegram-based interface for decentralized finance (DeFi) utilities, token tracking, and eventually trading integration.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**ShadowDEX Bot** is a Telegram bot designed to make DeFi tools more accessible and actionable from within Telegram. It will evolve from simple wallet/token tracking into a powerful assistant that integrates token data, alerts, swap interfaces, and more.

> 🌐 Goal: Simplify access to DeFi tools for everyday users through an intuitive Telegram experience.
