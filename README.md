‚úÖ Commit Message:

Fix: Improve /price command accuracy by enforcing symbol-based token lookup


---

üìù Update Summary for README or Changelog:

üöÄ Enhancements

Reworked /price command to use only token symbols for CoinGecko ID mapping (e.g., /price btc, /price eth, /price sol).

Added a fallback map (TOKEN_ID_MAP) with hardcoded popular token symbols to avoid incorrect matches from CoinGecko's coins/list API.

Implemented a safe population method to extend TOKEN_ID_MAP with additional symbols from CoinGecko‚Äîwithout overwriting trusted defaults.


üõ† Fixes

Fixed issue where token names (e.g., bitcoin) returned incorrect prices due to conflicts with clone/scam tokens on CoinGecko.

Prevented ambiguous lookups by disabling token name matching‚Äîonly symbols are accepted now (like btc, not bitcoin).


üí° Notes

Usage of /price must now be strictly by token symbol:

‚úÖ /price btc

‚úÖ /price eth

‚ùå /price bitcoin (will now return a helpful error)


This greatly improves accuracy and security of price responses.
